                <p>U-tec’s Products use a unique encryption algorithm to decompose finger scan image data to

                    be reversed to a fingerprint image and cannot be used by a third party. U-tec Products do not
                    capture, collect, obtain, or record users’ fingerprints and no information stored within the
                    Products are transmitted outside the Products and will never be shared to any third party.</p>
